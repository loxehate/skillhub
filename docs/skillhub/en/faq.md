# FAQ

## Q: What is the difference between SkillHub and ClawHub?

A: SkillHub is an enterprise-grade, self-hosted solution that provides stronger access control, review mechanisms, and governance capabilities. ClawHub is a public registry, similar to npm.

**Key Differences**:

| Feature | SkillHub | ClawHub |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted | Public cloud |
| **Access Control** | Namespace RBAC | Basic permissions |
| **Review Mechanism** | Multi-level review | None |
| **Security Scanning** | Built-in Skill Scanner | None |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Fully self-managed | Hosted in the cloud |
| **Use Case** | Enterprise internal | Public sharing |

## Q: How do I back up data?

A: SkillHub stores data in PostgreSQL and object storage. Regularly backing up these two components is sufficient.

**Back up PostgreSQL**:
```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres skillhub > backup.sql
```

**Back up Object Storage**:
- If using MinIO, back up the MinIO data directory
- If using S3, use the AWS CLI or an S3 backup tool

## Q: What authentication methods are supported?

A: SkillHub supports multiple authentication methods:

- **OAuth2**: GitHub, Google, GitLab, etc.
- **Local Accounts**: Username/password login (built-in administrator: admin / ChangeMe!2026)
- **Enterprise SSO**: Integrates with LDAP, SAML, etc.

Refer to the authentication configuration section in the project README for setup instructions.

## Q: Is there a size limit for skill packages?

A: The default limit is **100MB**. This can be adjusted via configuration:

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  servlet:
    multipart:
      max-file-size: 100MB
      max-request-size: 100MB
```

## Q: How do I use the CLI tool to manage skill packages?

A: SkillHub is compatible with the OpenClaw CLI. Use the `npx clawhub` command to interact with it:

```bash
# Configure the registry URL
export CLAWHUB_REGISTRY=http://your-skillhub-host:8080

# Search for skill packages
npx clawhub search email

# Install a skill package
npx clawhub install my-skill

# Publish a skill package
npx clawhub publish ./my-skill
```

## Q: How do I configure HTTPS?

A: For production environments, it is recommended to use Nginx or Traefik as a reverse proxy with SSL certificates.

**Nginx Configuration Example**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name skillhub.example.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }
    
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

## Q: How do I monitor SkillHub?

A: SkillHub provides several monitoring options:

- **Health Check**: `GET /actuator/health`
- **Scanner Health Check**: `GET http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Metrics**: `GET /actuator/metrics` (Prometheus format)
- **Audit Logs**: All critical operations are recorded in the audit log
- **Application Logs**: Collect logs using ELK or Loki

## Q: Does it support multi-tenancy?

A: SkillHub achieves logical multi-tenant isolation through namespaces. Each namespace acts as a tenant with its own members, permissions, and skill packages.

For physical isolation, you can deploy a separate SkillHub instance for each tenant.

## Q: How do I upgrade SkillHub?

A: Use the curl command to upgrade:

```bash
# Pull the latest images and restart
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- pull
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- down
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up

# Or upgrade to a specific version
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up --version v0.2.0
```

> **Note**: It is recommended to back up the database and object storage before upgrading. Database migrations are handled automatically by Flyway.
